# 🏀 Dunker Madness - My First Unity Mobile Game  

## 🎮 About the Project  

**Dunker Madness** is my **first 2D mobile game project**, developed to explore Unity's **mobile physics and gameplay mechanics**. The game is built around a **tower destruction concept**, where players aim and shoot projectiles to knock down enemy structures.  

This project also helped me learn **Unity's mobile optimization techniques**, including **Cinemachine Dynamic Zoom**, to ensure smooth gameplay across all screen sizes. The game is fully functional on **Android and iOS**, with an initial successful test on Android.
